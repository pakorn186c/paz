# Ubidots

[Ubidots](https://ubidots.com/) allows you to rapidly assemble and launch
Internet of Things (IoT) applications without having to write code or hire
a software development team. You can sign up for a free
account at [https://ubidots.com](https://ubidots.com/).

To add the integration in Console, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu.
Select the integration to add - in this case, the **Ubidots** integration as
shown below.

The next step is to enter your Ubidots Auth Token.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are
named identifiers, that can be used to associate an integration with a device.
To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the
same label to both the device and integration. Labels need to be created before
attaching them to devices and integrations. Read more on this [here](../labels).
